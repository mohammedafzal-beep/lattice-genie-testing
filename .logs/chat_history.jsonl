{"timestamp": "2025-12-11T11:35:16.133285", "username": "34271365", "role": "assistant", "content": "The simple cubic lattice structure offers moderate mechanical strength and stiffness due to its low packing density, making it less commonly used in high-strength applications. Here are the design parameters for the simple cubic lattice structure:\n\n- **S/V ratio**: Ratio of the surface area to the volume of the unit cell\n- **Sphere radius (r)**: Radius of the spheres at the corners of the unit cell\n- **Resolution**: Number of pixels used to generate the structure\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip 1: The S/V ratio value depends on other parameters, so its value can only be changed by tweaking other parameters values below it.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Tip 2: You can try lower resolution for experimentation, and use max resolution before downloading the STL file.\n\nPlease confirm if you would like to proceed with this structure."}
